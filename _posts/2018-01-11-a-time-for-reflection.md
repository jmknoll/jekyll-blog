With Christmas and New Years fading into the rearview mirror, and winter setting in for real here in Shanghai, the timing seems appropriate to write a slightly more personal post than I normally do here.

The technology industry is the largest and most important industry in the world today, and yet we collectively continue to be blind to the needs and desires of most of the world. Apple is the largest and most profitable company in the history of the world, and yet what portion of its employees have any real diversity of perspective? The company is mostly-male, mostly white or asian, and mostly American.

Facebook is, by many measures, the most-used website in the world. For much of the world's population, it is the internet. And yet basically all UX decisions are made by a handful of people in Palo Alto.

More alarming than the issues surrounding racial or gender diversity, though, are the issues of diversity of experience. All of these companies are composed almost entirely of people from (comparatively) privileged backgrounds, and of similar life experiences. 

I'm not singling out any particular company, this uniformity exists in the industry as a whole. How many countries are home to significant technology companies or significant VC players? 10? 15? Certainly not most. 

And I'm not just here to complain, I recognize that as unfortunate as this may be, it simply the way that they world works. Apple and Facebook both want to hire the smartest engineers in the world. While those people may look different in terms of the color of their skin, they are ultimately going to look pretty similar in terms of their life experiences (supportive, loving, family, world-class schools, test prepration and tutors, ivy league university, major tech company). With the reach and significance of the technology industry, I don't think that this is a good thing. But fixing this problem is a task for someone much more creative and intelligent than myself.

But in the meantime, I think that we, collectively, could all benefit from a little more understanding and empathy. With the sgnificance of the technology industry, its no longer okay to be the guy in a grungy metal shirt who doesn't need to understand business needs or customers because you're a programmer. As the entire world becomes our customers, its essential to understand who they are, where they're coming from, and what they actually want. Not only is this the right thing to do, but companies who do this well will be more succesful. 

To this end, I'm going to swap out some of my normal reading this year for books on psychology, relationships, and communication. Even if it doesn't make me a better programmer, I think it should hopefully make me a better person. I would recommend everyone else to do the same. 

After a bit of research, and some recommendations from friends, I'll be getting started with these two books. Seem like as good a place as any to start:
